  const aboutMe = `Hey there! I'm a passionate full-stack developer who loves building beautiful, functional web applications. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open source projects, or trying to perfect my coffee brewing technique. I believe great software comes from combining technical skill with creative problem-solving.

Currently obsessed with React, TypeScript, and making the web more accessible for everyone. Always down to chat about code, collaborate on projects, or debate the best VS Code themes!

Fun fact: I built this MySpace-inspired portfolio because I miss when the internet had more personality. Bring back the early 2000s web aesthetic! âœ¨`;

  const whoIdLikeToMeet = `Fellow developers who are passionate about clean code and user experience! I'd love to connect with:

â€¢ Frontend wizards who can make CSS do impossible things
â€¢ Backend architects who design elegant APIs
